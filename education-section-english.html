        <div class="education-intro">
            <p>At HELP TODAY, we believe that education transcends classrooms; it is the fundamental engine for human
                progress and an unavoidable responsibility to transform our environment. Based on principles of
                universal wisdom, our educational vision focuses on four pillars:</p>

        <div class="education-pillars">
            <!-- Pillar 1 -->
            <article class="education-pillar">
                <div class="pillar-number">1</div>
                <h3>Education is the Capacity to Act</h3>
                <p>Education is not just a personal privilege; it is a tool for service. As President Russell M. Nelson
                    taught, we must cultivate a deep desire to learn, as education marks "the difference between wanting
                    to help other people and being able to help them." There are no shortcuts to excellence; real
                    competence requires effort and dedication.</p>

            <!-- Pillar 2 -->
            <article class="education-pillar">
                <div class="pillar-number">2</div>
                <h3>Learning to Learn</h3>
                <p>Beyond memorizing data, our goal is to foster critical thinking. Elder David A. Bednar emphasizes
                    that we are here to "learn to love learning" and know what to do when we don't have immediate
                    answers. True education gives us the means to solve problems, innovate, and adapt—essential skills
                    in a changing world.</p>

            <!-- Pillar 3 -->
            <article class="education-pillar">
                <div class="pillar-number">3</div>
                <h3>Knowledge as Light and Power</h3>
                <p>Ignorance limits, but knowledge liberates. Quoting Robert D. Hales, education places us in a better
                    position to fight against error, as "knowledge dispels darkness, uncertainty, and doubt." An
                    educated mind is prepared for the future and has the power to positively influence its community.

                <div class="pillar-number">4</div>
                <h3>A Comprehensive Approach</h3>
                <p>We understand that learning happens everywhere. Education encompasses both formal instruction in
                    school and "informal learning from sources you trust" and everyday experiences. We seek to "broaden
                    the mind and skills" of each child, preparing them not only to earn money but to reach their full
                    potential as human beings.</p>

            <h3>Central Reflection</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The more we learn, the greater the influence we can have for good."</p>
                <cite>— Camille N. Johnson</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="reflection-conclusion">At HELP TODAY, we turn these words into action, ensuring that every child
                in Honduras has the tools to exert that positive influence on their future.</p>
